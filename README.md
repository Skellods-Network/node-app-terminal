# Node-App-Terminal

Extended Console Terminal for Node.JS applications

This module bundles different terminal functionalities which might be needed by big projects.
In detail, functionality for an "in-app terminal", "tasks + interim status", "menus" and other functionality will be added to this module.
To put it in a nutshell, Node-App-Terminal wants to provide a complete terminal interface for multipurpose Node.JS applications (for ex. SHPS).

This module was first created for SHPS, but then separated for easy use by everyone :)
